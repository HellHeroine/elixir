*  Whalesalad Elixir README
*****************************************************

	Hey there everyone, thanks for downloading my theme. I really hope you enjoy it!
	
*****************************************************
*  UPDATES
*****************************************************
	v1.1	9/27/07		The theme now works inside a sub-directory (haha) and will not explode if timesince.php is not enabled.
		
	v1.2	10/14/07	Removed the need for timesince plugin, all timesince functionality is now built into the theme using functions.php

	v1.3	1/14/08		Solved the bug regarding line 8 in header.php having invalid syntax.

*****************************************************
*  INSTALLATION
*****************************************************

	Simply copy the elixir directory (will be elixir_blue, elixir_lime, etc... depending on your color) to the /wp-content/themes/ directory, 
	and enabled it from the presentation area of your blog admin panel.

	The sidebar will need some editing. The "Latest Entries" and "My Homeboys (And Girls)" are all automatically generated. 
	The Homeboys are generated automatically from the Blogroll.

	You'll need to modify the links for the various pages of the site, it's very simple. Basic HTML knowledge is required.

*****************************************************
*  MODIFICATION
*****************************************************

	The theme is very easy to modify, simply edit three images which are:
		/img/nav_on.png
		/img/upperBox_bg.jpg
		/img/upperBox_search.png
	
	The best way to do this is using the Hue/Saturation tool in Photoshop. Adjust the hue of each image (same on each image) and save. 
	Then just set a few colors in the style.css file and you're good to go.

	If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at michael@whalesalad.com

	Finally, if you are feeling cheery a donation to help pay the server bill would be much appreciated, any amount is just dandy. 
	My paypal address is michael@whalesalad.com.

Happy Wordpressin'!
